# Bird List WordPress Theme

Developed by [Mike Carretta](http://mikecarretta.github.io)

Wordpress 3.8 and Bootstrap 3 merged together with a bit of Less customization.

Starting the birds theme using [_s or underscores](http://underscores.me) starter theme and using the [320press](https://github.com/320press/wordpress-bootstrap) theme as a source, which is also based on [Eddie Machado's Bones](https://github.com/eddiemachado/bones) starter theme.
